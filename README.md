# Hyper Terminal Preferences

These are the preferences for my [Hyper](https://hyper.is) Terminal. If you'd like to experience the full customization, please install [fish](https://fishshell.com).

To use this file, copy the contents into your local `.hyper.js` file and save. You will need to restart Hyper and update all plugins (Plugins -> Update All Now) after updating your preferences.
